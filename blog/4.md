okay we are switching to gitlab for now because gitea does not support graphql apparently

in the future we will just do it in docker containers i suppose.

have an index of docker containers and the repositories are just individual containers that can be orchestrated.

or just use github for now

okay i will use github for now

so what do i do now?

i need a web interface where i can type in plain text and it will be sent to github as an issue

i need to do it with the gh cli

that way its easiest to swap out later
