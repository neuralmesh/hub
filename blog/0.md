the goal is to have a locally hosted version control system

gitea seems like the perfect base for this

and llmos allows us to set it up exactly how we want

the goal is to make it into a node in the graph

for now we will use it to have a persistent index of all the relevant repositories for a project

in my case it will need to list:

- neuralmesh/llmos
- neuralmesh/hub
- neuralmesh/paper

it will also need to be able to instantly mirror pushes to github.com

it must support secure authentication

it must be able to have persistant storage in the case my pc shuts down and it was not yet synced to github
